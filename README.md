# Bhojpur GUI - Foundation Framework

The Bhojpur GUI is a standard `graphical user interface` development kit applied within the [Bhojpur.NET Platform](https://github.com/bhojpur/platform) ecosystem for delivering high performance, web-scale applications or services.

## General Usage

It is considered a `source code generator` for several operating environments. It speeds up the overall process of application development setup.

As an individual, you can use the `client-side` engine for such capabilities.

For enterprises, the `server-side` engine provides centralized control capabilities and `CI/CD` integration based on the GitOps methodology.

## Hosted Services Integration

There are several [Bhojpur.NET Platform](https://github.com/bhojpur/platform) services that are `customized`,`pre-integrated`, `tested`, `deployed`, and `managed` by distributed [Application Framework](https://github.com/bhojpur/application) team for a __subscription__ based pricing. All these hosted services could be utilized seamlessly by the [Bhojpur GUI](https://github.com/bhojpur/gui) application framework, by default.

However, you can change the `default` settings and connect to [Bhojpur.NET Platform](https://github.com/bhojpur/platform) services in a __self-hosted__ model using custom configuration.
