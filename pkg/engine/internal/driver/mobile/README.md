# Bhojpur GUI - Mobile Drivers

This directory is a fork of the `golang.org/x/mobile` package. It has largely
deviated from the original package to better support Bhojpur GUI application.

The full project, its license can be found at [Go Mobile](https://github.com/golang/mobile)

This package is for the purpose of removing the dependency of mobile `drivers`
and will be removed in due course.
