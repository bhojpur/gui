# Bhojpur GUI - Graphics Library

The `glfw` library provides a `glfw`-like API with desktop (via glfw) and web browser (via HTML5
canvas) backends. It is used for creating a `GL` context and receiving events.

**Note:** This package is currently in development. The API is incomplete and may change.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/bhojpur/gui/pkg/graphic/glfw
```
